# generator-library
This repository contains the generator library files for https://campaign-logger.com/generator which can be referenced like this: "{lib:adjColor}".


## Template

The *_empty_template* table contains a structure for creating complex tables that are compatible with different genres. Table names and comment fields requiring customization are marked with *XXX*.


## Credits

Typically the authors of each table are listed in the initial comment block of the files. Additionally Johnn Four, Jochen Linnemann and Ron Calbick are given general credit for their multiple contributions to the table library.
